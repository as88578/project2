## Problem Description:
We have found a data set that gives us information from the NYPD Shooting Incidents from 2006-2022. This data set has been found from the US Data Gov website. Within this data, the primary key is listed as INCIDENT_KEY and this gives an individual number for each of the incidents. The next column within the data set is OCCUR_DATE and the following one iS OCCUR_TIME, both of these are giving the date and time of when the incident occurred. Next, the column is BORO which shows the NY Borough in which the shooting happened, for example, "Manhattan, Brooklyn, ...". There is also a column for PRECINCT which also gives exact location information about the shooting. There is a LOCATION_DESC column (location description) in order to add details so some of the shootings such as "Grocery store" or "Jewelry Store". Within the data there is a column that is called STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG, the data for this column is all true or false and this means that if the shooting was considered a murder or not. After this column, there are 3 columns describing the Perpetrator with their age group, their sex, and their race. Following with 3 columns describing the Victims age group, sex, and race as well. The last columns are describing the Coordinates of where they believe that the shooting took place. 

## Data Model Questions:

During the year 2020, the amount of shootings throughout all of the bouroughs increased. We noticed that the spike in Brooklyn shootings increased the most. Especially throughout July, we can see that that is the month that caused the biggest increase in number of shootings. This data gives us more information about the months during COVID and we can see that during these months and through our graph which the safest bouroughs are throughout New York.
